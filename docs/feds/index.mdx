The following is a growing, non-exhaustive list of faux dissident movements used by the world's governments, as a means to break the law and violate national constitutions without a hint of accountability.

# Right-wing

## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ United States of America

* [GDL AKA "Goyim Defense League"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goyim_Defense_League)
  * Led by Mexican-American [Jon Minadeo II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Minadeo_II) AKA "Handsome Truth".
    * Minadeo has not held a steady job in his entire life, with the exception of a short stint at his family's restaurant.
      * Despite his inability to perform lawful employment and having been disowned by his own family, Minadeo appears to live a carefree life without financial problems. This suggests outside funding. 
  * Widely used to terrorize the local populace and left-wing dissidents, enabling a swift push for anti-free speech laws.
  * Currently utilized by Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, with the explicit aim of criminalizing anti-Israel speech.

* [Blood Tribe](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/blood-tribe) (Not to be confused with the Canadian First Nations tribe of the same nomer)
  * Led by [Christopher Pohlhaus](https://www.dreshare.com/christopher-pohlhaus/), a mentally deranged tattoo artist from San Antonio, Texas.
    * Pohlhaus and his wife moved to Maine in 2022, with the stated aim of creating a "White Ethnostate". His actions have been widely used as the pretext for a [new migrant program](https://www.themainewire.com/2023/08/maine-governor-wants-to-resettle-75000-foreign-born-migrants-in-maine-by-2029/)
      announced by Maine's governor in AUgust 2023, achieving the exact opposite of a "White Ethnostate".
  * Like the GDL, the Blood Tribe is being used by powerful Liberal and Conservative politicians as a means to deligitimize political activism.
  * Like its German counterpart, Der III Weg, Blood Tribe has been linked to Ukrainian weapons trafficking.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German Federal Republic

* [Der III Weg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way_(Germany))
  * Used by the federal government to suppress any form of meaningful right-wing activism.
  * Has previously been linked to weapons deliveries to Ukraine. Acknowledged but never further investigated, as said weapons trafficking benefits government policy.
    * https://www.bundestag.de/presse/hib/kurzmeldungen-891710
 * [NSU (formerly)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Underground)
   * Masterminded several politically motivated murders, including the death of a policewoman.
     * London based [Forensic Architecture](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/the-murder-of-halit-yozgat) exposed the German state security's involvement in the murders.
   * Officially disbanded in 2011 but surviving elements murdered the Conservative politician [Walter LÃ¼bcke](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/mordfall-luebcke-und-nsu-immer-wieder-temme-16440141.html) in 2019.
